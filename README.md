# Hangman
Hangman is a classic game in which one player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the player tries to guess it. 

The purpose of this of this project is to put everything I have learnt so far into practice, and to make me use git and GitHub much more than I currently do!

The source code is written in python and currently contains 5 files, 5 milestone files and a template.

Simply clone this repository and run the latest milestone. Enter this into your terminal to play:
python milestone_5.py

You have 5 lives, good luck!
